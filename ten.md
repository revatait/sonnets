Shivers of sharks and those eagle rays,
highlights of Maafushi scuba diving
when Rachel joined us for resort forays.
Here’s to buffet dinners, ferry riding,
a flight to Colombo, under the stars
then the big New Year's Eve fireworks fly.
Here's to Mirissa’s peacocks, Yala’s jaguars,
to scenic trains, tea fields, Rachel's goodbye.
yet a pleasing week in ella
hiking and 
awful training
through tea fields

regal, like the Taj Mahal and Jaipur.
