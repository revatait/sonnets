While at a Vipassana retreat last year, I began composing poems (instead of meditating). I had been memorizing poetry with the method of loci, and I had been studying bits and bobs about poetry. In particular, the idea of corona appealed to me: fourteen sonnets linked in such a way that their links create a fifteenth ("master") sonnet, one sonnet for each "chapter" of our two year trip.

I wound up composing and memorizing four and a half sonnets without writing or talking. On the final day, when we received our belongings back, I jotted them down quickly. I worked very hard on the sonnets around then and then again in November/December of 2017.

The end goal is a self-bound/handmade book with some of our best travel photos printed longside the sonnets.

While this is rather unlike the typical use-case for git/github, in hindsight, it would've been absolutely brilliant to have had version control set up for the millions of edits I've done to these poems. I'd love to be able to go back and see my intermediary drafts, especially of the parts I'm not happy with right now.

And so I shall commit my little edits from here on out and see what can be gained by such a granular view of the poetry editing process.
