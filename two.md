The dreams, the plans, and all the lengthy flights
and then a surprise trip to Tokyo!
Here's to autumn leaves and the chilly nights,
the scale, the crowds, the trains, the constant flow.
Here's to Shibuya, by us people whizzed,
and the onsen, a most heavenly dip.
Here's to our ninth night (our flight we had missed)
and Narita, a highlight of the trip.
But back to Queensland and the sizzling heat,
to Stradbroke island, surfing on Christmas,
and holidays with all new Taits to meet!
The first five months of the trip behind us,
it was finally the time to switch gears
from Brissie to Tassie as volunteers.
