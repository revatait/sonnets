Here's to the Great Ocean Road, Mom, the van,
then one month roaming around, amazing.
Oh, here's to each night in a new post code,
awaking to cows, later stargazing,
eating dinners on the camp stove at nights:
canned beans and noodles, cheap bottles of wine.
The Blue Mountains, Canberra, so many sites -
a folk festival, beaches, and sunshine!
Then Dad and Rachel landing in Airlie,
practicing our SCUBA skills on the Reef.
Here’s to Manly, the Bridge Climb, wine tours, tea.
Their visit to Australia was too brief,
yet so many things left us without speech:
here's to swirling sands at Whitehaven Beach.

blue skies, mozzies, John’s guitar, stargazing,
Here’s to Byron Bay, the van in the rain towed,
Here’s to high quality campgrounds within reach,
too much to see, so two weeks was a reach.

Here's to the Great Ocean Road, Mom, the van
month roaming around; life was amazing.



To Mom, the van, the winding ocean road,
after #vanlife, that month was amazing.
