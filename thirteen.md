To Europe, then, and something quite sneaky,
to sidewalks, fresh air, charming travel ease,
and autumn plans in Europe - so cheeky! -
and Will and Tammy’s fete, June's chilly breeze,
day trips to Heidelberg, Munich, Dachau,
then Dad and Rachel’s cars and castles, parks,
biergartens - masses they carried somehow -
before Zermatt's and Geneva's landmarks!
Here's to Provence, ancient bridges and forts,
to fields of lavender under a blue sky
to T’ronto’s landing and Hannah’s reports,
to nerves awry, dropped jaws 
At home, at last, after all we did see,
here’s to my love who shared all this with me.



A week in fair Provence, almost
Here's to the end, telling the trip goodbye,
Here's to roving Avignon's promenades,
At home, at last, after all we did see,


dusty, giddy
Here's to France, the end, the final escapes,
to fields of lavender under a blue sky
to T’ronto’s landing and Hannah’s updates,
