Hereâ€™s to swirling sands at Whitehaven Beach,		
then work in heavenly, fun Byron Bay		
while John found mechanics just within reach.		
Siblings arrived, time at the Reef to play:		
here's to the sea turtle, cassowary,		
koalas, kangaroos, (penguins mating).		
A family reunion, making merry		
with a gaggle of Taits participating.		
Here's to the flat in Manly, seeing whales		
before Sam arrived, surprise Adelaide,		
podcasts on the drive hiking wild trails,		
and seeing Uluru before we stayed		
to watch birds, drink tea in northeast Queensland.		
After family time, to Auckland we ran.		
		
then Sydney, long walks under a clear sky.		
		
in northeast Queensland, well off the main road.		
		
captivating		
		
after family time, to New Zealand we ran.		
with a gaggle of Taits - fascinating!
