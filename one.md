Here's to two wandering, magical years,
but first, to packing up and saying some
goodbyes with hugs and with just a few tears.
After years of hopes, the hour had come -
the time to board our transpacific flight!
Here's to Graham at the airport that first day
and his advice to start our year off right
with help from Anne, Bianca, and Renee.
Here's to kangaroos and koalas' charms,
trips to Noosa, Toowoomba, Byron Bay,
yoga, farmers markets, early alarms,
and learning to drive the opposite way,
to kirtan, housemates, new friends, dinner nights,
the dreams, the plans, and all the lengthy flights.


goodbyes with hugs, parties, and a few tears.


I don't like have flight + flights as endings in the same sonnet!
I don't really like that last line anyway.
I should go look up what it used to be in my notebook.


Here's to Graham at the airport that first day
to help us start our year in Oz off right
with help from Anne, Bianca, and Renee.
