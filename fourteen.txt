Here's to my love, who shared all this with me - 
seeing whales, missing flights, buying a van,
crossing Mordor, scrambling up that one tree,
getting lost whether or not it was part of the plan,
diving the depths to see colors so bold,
lugging bags, carrying a tiny wardrobe,
chasing gurus, seeing friends new and old.
We did it!
           We made it 'round the whole globe!
John Tait, my best friend, my partner in crime,
here's to you! Here's to us! Here's to love! And
here's to our family's support all this time!
Here's to adventures ahead hand in hand.
So let's raise our glasses and let’s say cheers -
here's to two wandering, magical years!
